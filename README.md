# Amazon Sales Data Engineering Project

This project focuses on building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process and analyze Amazon products data from a CSV file as a source. Using Apache Airflow for orchestration and automation of the operations, and Supabase for database management. This project efficiently organizes data for Business Intelligence (BI) and analysis, for this we use Google Looker Studio to generate visualizations and charts based on the processed data with some attributes like `Product name`, `Categories`, `Subcategories`, `Prices`, `Ratings` and `Reviews`.
